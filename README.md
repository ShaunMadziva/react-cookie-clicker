# React Cookie Clicker

## Reflection:

I manged to get the basic functionality to work, inorder to meet the requirements.

I didn't attempt any of the stetch goals, beacuse I spent a lot of time getting my head around how the react hooks work. I'll circle back to making this more of a fun game later.


### User Stories:

🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that the user’s interactions with the app are smooth and their data is managed effectively.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to manage game time with setInterval, return a cleanup function, and use a dependency array so that the game runs efficiently and updates in real-time for the user.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.
🐿️ As a user, I want the application to automatically update the game state every second so that I can see my progress and earned cookies in real-time, making the game more exciting and rewarding.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the .map() function to render lists of items efficiently so that the user can see dynamic content without performance issues.
🐿️ As a user, I want to purchase upgrades with my earned cookies to increase my cookies per second, making the gameplay more rewarding.

### Requirements:

🎯 Implement the useState hook.
🎯 Use useEffect effectively.
🎯 Return JSX from a source other than App.jsx, for example, by using components.
🎯 Apply setInterval to execute periodic tasks within the application.
🎯 Use the .map() function to render lists of items in the application dynamically.
🎯 Use logic to manage the purchase and application of upgrade items within the game.


### Stretch User Stories:

🐿️ As a user, I want the application to save and retrieve my game data so that my progress is preserved even when I close and reopen the game.
🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use an API to retrieve upgrade information so that users can access current upgrade details and seamlessly integrate them into their gameplay.
🐿️ As a user, I want the application to have excellent UI styling so that it is visually appealing and provides a pleasant and intuitive experience while playing the game.

### Stretch Requirements:

🏹 Use local storage to save and retrieve game data.
🏹 Use the Upgrades API to manage upgrades.
🏹 Style the application excellently.
